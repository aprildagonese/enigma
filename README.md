# Enigma Self-Evaluation

Functionality
--------------
4 - Method and CLI for cracking have been implemented


OOP
--------------
3 - Project has 1 class and 4 modules (I used modules instead of additional classes, because so few components needed to store state), each with separate logical responsibilities. No methods are longer than 7 lines, and no class or module is longer than 55 lines.


TDD
--------------
3 - Every method is fully tested, with 100% coverage, all named and fairly clear


Version Control
--------------
4 - Currently at 40 commits and 18 PRs, all named and fairly clear.
